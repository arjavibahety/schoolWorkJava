<h3>Problem Description</h3>

<p>The Kent Ridge Cruise Centre has just opened and <!-- as NUS undergraduates, -->
you are required to design a program to determine how much equipment 
to buy based on a given daily cruise schedule.
There can be up to 30 cruises that can arrive in a day. 
Each cruise ship can be one of two types:
<ul>
  <li>Normal Cruise:
    <ul>
      <li>Takes 30min for a loader to fully load</li>
      <li>Requires only one loader</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Big Cruise (with a cruise code that starts with 'B'):
    <ul>
      <li>Takes 60min for loaders to fully load</li>
      <li>Requires two loaders</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Furthermore, as the Cruise Centre wants to go green, their policy states that
  every third loader purchased must be a loader made from recycled materials 
  (referred to as a recycled loader), which undergoes maintenance for
  one hour after each service. The recycled loader is unable to serve a cruise 
  during the maintenance period.
</p>

<p>
  The program determines the number of loaders and the allocation schedule by the 
  following steps (sub-optimal):
  <ul>
    <li>
      For each cruise, check through the inventory of loaders, starting from the loader 
      first purchased and so on.
    </li>
    <li>The first (or first two) loaders available will be used to serve the cruise.</li>
    <li>
      If there are not enough loaders, purchase a new one(s), and that loader(s) will 
      be used to serve the cruise.</li>
    <li>Every third loader purchased must be a recycled loader.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Task</h3>

<p>
  Write a program that reads as input the number of cruises in the schedule as an integer, followed by a list of cruises 
  that will arrive for that day.
  <br>
  <br>
  The program will output 
  <ul>
    <li>The number of cruises</li>
    <li>The number of big cruises</li>
    <li>The number of loaders required</li>
    <li>The number of recycled loaders required</li>
    <li>The loader allocation schedule</li>
    <li>The recycled loader allocation schedule</li>
  </ul>
</p>


<p>
  Take note of the following assumptions:
  <ul>
    <li>Input cruises are presented chronologically by arrival time</li>
	<li>There can be up to 30 cruises in one day</li>
	<li>There are no duplicate cruises in the input</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
Although the solution to this problem can be implemented procedurally, you should learnt to model the solution using an object-oriented approach instead.
</p>

<p>This task is divided into five levels.
You need to complete <b>ALL</b> levels.
</p>

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=10>

<tr><td><h4>Level 1</h4>

<p>
  <big><strong>Represent a Cruise</strong></big>
</p>

<p>Write a program that reads in the number of cruises that arrive in a particular day, and the corresponding cruise schedule.<br>
Then, print out the cruise schedule in the format as <tt>cruiseCode@time</tt>.
As an example, <tt>A1234@1330</tt> denotes that cruise A1234 arrives at 1330hrs.

<p>The following is a sample run of the program.

<tr><td><h4>Level 2</h4>

<p>
  <big><strong>Find the allocation schedule for loaders</strong></big>
</p>

<p>Write a program that reads in the number of cruises that arrive in a particular day, and the corresponding cruise schedule.<br>
Then, print out the allocation schedule for each loader.<br>
Ensure that each line denoting the cruise served is prefixed with four spaces.<br>
In this level, all cruises (even those with codes that begin with 'B') will be taken as a normal cruise.<br>
The Cruise Centre's go-green policy has not been in place as of yet. All loaders purchased are not recycled.
